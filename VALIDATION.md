# Fresh website validation — 9 October 2026

## Scope

A fresh static website repository for ongoing EDUCADE front-end development.
Backend work and moving the live domain are outside the current scope.

## Verification

- Frozen npm install (`npm ci`) completed using the committed dependency lockfile.
- `npm run build` validated the Cloudflare static asset deployment configuration
  in dry-run mode. No production deployment was executed by that check.
- `npm run dev` starts Cloudflare's local Workers runtime and serves `public/`.
- Browser checks exercise widths of 1440, 1024, 768, 640, 390 and 320 pixels.
- Checks cover image loading, horizontal overflow, mobile navigation,
  class/student preview switching, keyboard controls, and the sample challenge.
- Signup interface tests use mocked responses and do not validate contact storage.
- All 12 approved image assets remain byte-for-byte unchanged from the supplied ZIP.

The missing rope sprite is replaced by CSS views of the existing approved
NPC dialogue illustration. The mobile headline has a spacing correction, and
the original logo has a light backing in the dashboard previews for legibility.

Run `tests/browser_smoke.py` to reproduce the browser checks. The final screenshots
for the current development environment are in `/workspace/educade-validation/fresh`.
