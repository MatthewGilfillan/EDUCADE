# Fresh website validation — 9 October 2026

## Scope

A fresh static website repository for ongoing EDUCADE front-end development.
Backend work and moving the live domain are outside the current scope.

## Verification

- Frozen npm install (`npm ci`) completed using the committed dependency lockfile.
- `npm run build` validated the Cloudflare static asset deployment configuration
  in dry-run mode. No production deployment was executed by that check.
- `npm run dev` starts Cloudflare's local Workers runtime and serves `public/`.
- Browser checks exercise widths of 1440, 1024, 768, 640, 390 and 320 pixels.
- Checks cover image loading, horizontal overflow, mobile navigation,
  class/student preview switching, keyboard controls, and the sample challenge.
- Signup interface tests use mocked responses and do not validate contact storage.
- All 12 approved image assets remain byte-for-byte unchanged from the supplied ZIP.

The missing rope sprite is replaced by CSS views of the existing approved
NPC dialogue illustration. The mobile headline has a spacing correction, and
the original logo has a light backing in the dashboard previews for legibility.

Run `tests/browser_smoke.py` to reproduce the browser checks. The final screenshots
for the current development environment are in `/workspace/educade-validation/fresh`.

## Interactive teacher dashboard

The standalone page public/teacher.html adds real UI components; neither dashboard
reference image is used to render it. It uses the unchanged assets/logo.png.

- 51 expandable curriculum groups and 127 EDUCADE skill IDs.
- Representative evidence for 17 skills per learner; 2,040 fictional responses
  shared by class/profile scores, support counts, hints, evidence and trends.
- Reading Foundations and Reading Comprehension are separate views.
- Unassessed skills show No evidence yet and are excluded from score/chart math.
- Radar charts plot only assessed groups (at most four here); fewer than three
  assessed groups use bars rather than fabricating additional axes.
- Four data-consistency tests passed; browser checks passed at 1440, 1024, 768,
  640, 390 and 320 pixels, including search, sorting, six learners, all domains,
  HP/radar switches, evidence dialogs, empty evidence, tab keys and Escape.
- Landing-page browser checks passed at the same six widths. Git comparison
  confirms the landing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, signup and artwork are unchanged.
- CCSS mapping candidates are separate from EDUCADE IDs, with verification
  pending because the official standards site returned a proxy 403.
- No accounts, payments, live AI assessment or contact/student storage were added.
- Changes are restricted to development; main and educade.io are not updated.
